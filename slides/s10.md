Intro to Databases and SQL
==========================

---

## What is a database?

A database is a system to store structured data.
Data is stored in tables.
Think of Excel sheets.

Ex.

table: people

| name | zipcode | dob |
|------|---------|-----|
| Alice | 60030  | 2-1-1980 |
| Bob  | 60040   | 2-10-1983 |
| Carl | 80040   | 12-20-1978 |

table: pets

| name | kind | dob | owner |
|------|------|-----|-------|
| Fido | dog  | 1-1-2020 | Bob |
| Dash | cat  | 6-12-2024 | Bob |
| Max  | gecko | 8-1-2020 | Carl |

## Why a database instead of a spreadsheet?

* Fast storage and retrieval of data.
* Multiple users working concurrently.
* Capable of handling vast number of records.

---

## What is SQL

SQL: Structured Query Language

A language for interacting with databases.

* Data retrieval.
* Data management (add, remove, change).
* Data transformation (aggregation, sorting, grouping, counting).

Like any programming language, SQL has reserved words
and its own specific grammar.

## Data retrieval

To retrieve data, we use the `SELECT` statement.

Ex:

```sql
SELECT * FROM people;
```

| name | zipcode | dob |
|------|---------|-----|
| Alice | 60030  | 2-1-1980 |
| Bob  | 60040   | 2-10-1983 |
| Carl | 80040   | 12-20-1978 |

```sql
SELECT name, kind FROM pets;
```

| name | dob |
|------|-----|
| Fido | dog |
| Dash | cat |
| Max  | gecko |

* Can you identify syntax patterns in these statements?

---

```sql
SELECT columns FROM tables;
```

`SELECT` and `FROM` are reserved words.

Grammar:

`SELECT` (`*` | *columns*) `FROM` *tables* `;`

columns: [table.]column [, column]
tables: table1 [, table2]
